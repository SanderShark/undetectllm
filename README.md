# Beat the detection, or maybe just detect better, you pick.
So a friend of mine who takes college courses remotely came to me this week ranting about how his professor had run his written works through an AI detector and it had come back as AI. I was not really surprised by this entirely, he had mentioned he uses ChatGPT as a writing aid, and quite frankly, I am not sure there is anything wrong with that. But it did spark my curiosity, I wanted to see if that article id read months back about how the detectors saw the constitution as generated was still the norm. Well, I got a bit more involved then that, full on lets beat the tests style. Here is my research, I will include a GitHub repo with the data, since there will be a lot of repetition here. 



This repo contains each set of data I used for the rotation through the tools. all of it will be in a single .md file in the format I used when running the tests.
